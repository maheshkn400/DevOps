# Install Git on Mac

Most versions of MacOS will already have Git installed, and you can activate it through the terminal with `git version`. However, if you don't have Git installed for whatever reason, you can install the latest version of Git using one of several popular methods as listed below:

#### Install Git From an Installer

1. Download the latest version of [macOS Git Installer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/git-2.23.0-intel-universal-mavericks.dmg/download?use_mirror=autoselect).
2. Once the installer has started, follow the instructions as provided until the installation is complete.
3. Open the command prompt "terminal" and type git version to verify Git was installed.

Note: `git-scm` is a popular and recommended resource for downloading Git on a Mac. The advantage of downloading Git from git-scm is that your download automatically starts with the latest version of Git. The download source is the same [macOS Git Installer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/git-2.23.0-intel-universal-mavericks.dmg/download?use_mirror=autoselect) as referenced in the steps above.

#### Install Git from Homebrew

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a popular package manager for macOS. If you already have Homwbrew installed, you can follow the below steps to install Git:

Open up a terminal window and install Git using the following command: `brew install git`.
Once the command output has completed, you can verify the installation by typing: `git version`.
